 Deep Learning & AI Applications

ðŸ”¹ Lesson 1: Deep Learning Essentials
=====================================
Summary:
Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to automatically learn complex patterns from large datasets.
Works well for images, audio, and text
Requires large datasets + GPUs for training

Example:
Classifying handwritten digits (MNIST dataset) with 98%+ accuracy using a neural network.


ðŸ”¹ Lesson 2: TensorFlow for Beginners
=====================================
Summary:
TensorFlow is a popular framework for building deep learning models.
Build computational graphs
Train models efficiently on CPU/GPU
Large community + pre-trained models available

Example:
Training a simple neural network to classify flowers using TensorFlow.


ðŸ”¹ Lesson 3: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
================================================
Summary:
CNNs are specialized for image processing.
Layers: Convolution â†’ Pooling â†’ Fully Connected
Detect edges, shapes, then full objects

Example:
Detecting cats vs dogs in pictures with a CNN trained on image datasets.


ðŸ”¹ Lesson 4: NLP with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
=====================================================
Summary:
RNNs are designed for sequential data (like text).
Memory of past inputs â†’ good for sentences
Used in chatbots, translations, and speech recognition

Example:
Predicting the next word in a sentence using an RNN language model.


ðŸ”¹ Lesson 5: Case Study â€“ Healthcare Predictive Analytics
=========================================================
Summary:
Deep learning models help in medical diagnosis.
CNNs â†’ detect tumors in X-rays
RNNs â†’ predict patient readmission risk
TensorFlow â†’ scalable deployment

Example:
A hospital reduced readmission rates by 12% using predictive analytics with RNNs.
